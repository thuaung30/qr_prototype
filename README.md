# qr_prototype

A prototype Flutter project for generating qr code and saving them to gallery.

## Getting Started

Since this repo is a prototyp, there is no control over which data to encode into qr and the data to be encoded can come in different flavours so the data part can be implemented later.

1. Git clone this repo.

`git clone https://thuaung30/qr_prototype.git`

2. Install necessary dependencies.

`flutter pub get`

3. Run the application.

`flutter run`

4. Press "Save to gallery" and check the saved qr code in gallery.
